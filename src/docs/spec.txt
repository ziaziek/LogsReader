Initially we assume that the format of the log files is as follows (from the project that this is supposed to serve):
[%-4r] [%d{ISO8601}] [%t] [%c] [%l] [%-5p] [%m]%n, which means:
[time] [date] [thread] [className] [source] [level] [message] newLine


Application will give the user opportunity to change (match) the columns from the specified log file
to columns that are available in the LogsReader.
